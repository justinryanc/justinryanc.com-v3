**New website is live!**

I've used WordPress for at least a decade and the constant updates, security exploits, recurring licensing and hosting costs were just too much effort to maintain.  I've tested static site generators for a few years and decided it was time to officially make the switch.  That's where Hugo came in, it's a static site generator that essentially builds your site from Markdown files and offers theme support as well.

Fortunately there are many ways to install and deploy a site with Hugo, such as GitHub, Cloudflare, etc.  I originally chose the Azure route since I'm an Azure guy but ultimately I decided to abandon Azure and DevOps for simplicity.  I did get it working with an Azure Static Web App and DevOps, even created a self-hosted pipeline for ADO as well.  It was just too complex for what I wanted.

I'm proud to go live today with my new Hugo generated site, it's code is stored in GitHub and I'm also using GitHub Pages to host it for free!  The GitHub repo for this site is located at [https://github.com/justinryanc/justinryanc.com-v3](https://github.com/justinryanc/justinryanc.com-v3) if you want to take a look.
